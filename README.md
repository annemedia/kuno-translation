# Kuno - Translation help needed

Since Kuno launched, the Monero community has been nothing short of amazing in their support of various community projects focused on raising awareness and promoting PR for Monero. They've also been incredibly generous in supporting charity projects and assisting with immediate personal medical care needs, as well as helping with the purchase of technical devices or equipment. As of today, on the 20th of October 2023, Kuno has helped to raise over 65 XMR, and it has made a significant impact on many people's lives.

Would you like to make a difference? We think it would be fantastic if Kuno was accessible in more languages. Right now, the website is only available in English, Esperanto, Spanish and Italian. If you possess the necessary skills to translate the Kuno website into another language, please consider lending your expertise to the translation effort.

### HOW TO ADD A NEW TRANSLATION

```
See translation.php

Copy the whole function "translate_en" and rename the copy to eg. "translate_de".

Translate the text on the right after "=>", don't change the strings on the left ("page_title", "nav_manage_fundraiser", etc.).

Do NOT translate the parts of text in curly brackets {GUID}, {AMOUNT}, {DATE}, etc.

Keep the 'quotes' around the translation and the comma after the translation.

If you need to use single quotes inside the translation, add a slash \ in front, like this \'example\'
or use a ‘smart quote’ like this ’ instead.

HTML is allowed in translations. Do NOT translate any HTML tags, classes, or URL links.
```

### HOW TO SUBMIT COMPLETED TRANSLATION

a) Fork this repo and submit a  new file via pull request For example, translation_de.php... [how to submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui)
