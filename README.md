# Kuno - Translation help needed

[kuno.anne.media](https://kuno.anne.media)

## HOW TO ADD A NEW TRANSLATION

Copy the whole function "translate_en" and rename the copy to eg. "translate_de".

Translate the text on the right after "=>", don't change the strings on the left ("page_title", "nav_manage_fundraiser", etc.).

Do NOT translate the parts of text in curly brackets {GUID}, {AMOUNT}, {DATE}, etc.

Keep the 'quotes' around the translation and the comma after the translation.

If you need to use single quotes inside the translation, add a slash \ in front, like this \'example\'
or use a ‘smart quote’ like this ’ instead.

HTML is allowed in translations. Do NOT translate any HTML tags, classes, or URL links.

## HOW TO SUBMIT COMPLETED TRANSLATION

a) Fork this repo and submit a  new file via pull request For example, translation_de.php...
